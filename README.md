# Treble

Treble is a simple iOS music player app that can play music directly from Apple Music or via iCloud Drive. This app was originally built to support a landscape version of the Now Playing screen since my dock blocked the speaker grills under the iPhone. Decided to write this nice and simple app as a fun open-source side project to support that.

Most recently, this app was rewritten to use UIStackView instead of manual Auto Layout constraint building, and to also make the MediaPlayer source generic. Pull requests are welcome!
