# Treble

Treble is a simple iOS audio player app that plays music directly from your Apple Music library or audio files from your iCloud Drive. The app was originally built to support a landscape-orientation Now Playing screen as Apple Music no longer supported that on iPhone and my iPhone dock blocks the speaker grills while in portrait orientation. Later, I decided to expand this app a bit as a fun little open-source project to support playing audio files from iCloud.
